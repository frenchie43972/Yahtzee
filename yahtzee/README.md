Welcome, everything is fine!

I loved playing Yahtzee as a kid (and still do!) and have been thinking for a while now about making a Yahtzee game as a small project. I got stuck thinking that I needed to learn x, y and z before even starting, but after speaking with the developers at my work, they advised me to just freakin' start because you will always feel you do not know enough. They are right: I can get a decent version of the game working and go back and make improvements as I learn more, so here we go!

My intention for this project is not only to build and learn as I go, but to document my steps as I go not only for me to look back on and reference for future projects, but for anyone interested on my process and thinking throughout the project.
